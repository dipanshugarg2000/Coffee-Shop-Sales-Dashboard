# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard
Overview

This project is an Excel-based dashboard that visualizes key sales metrics for a coffee shop. The dashboard provides insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance, helping to make data-driven decisions for optimizing business operations.

Features

Total Revenue by Month (Line Graph): Tracks monthly revenue trends to identify peaks and troughs in sales over time.
Transactions by Day of the Week (Bar Graph): Displays transaction frequency by day to help determine the busiest and slowest days for the coffee shop.
Transactions by Hour of the Day (Bar Graph): Helps to identify key times during the day when the coffee shop experiences the most sales.
Transactions by Product Category (Bar Graph): Provides a breakdown of sales based on product categories (e.g., coffee, snacks, desserts) to highlight top-performing products.
Objectives

Identify Trends: Visualize the coffee shopâ€™s sales data to reveal patterns in customer behavior and product popularity.
Improve Efficiency: Use insights from the dashboard to make data-driven decisions, such as adjusting staffing levels during peak hours or promoting high-demand products.
Strategic Planning: Leverage sales trends to plan for special offers, seasonal promotions, or menu adjustments.
Tools & Technologies Used

Microsoft Excel: Used for data organization, analysis, and visualization.
Charts & Graphs: Line and bar graphs to visualize sales data in an intuitive way.
How to Use

Open the Excel File: You can open the dashboard on any version of Microsoft Excel.
Navigate to the Dashboard: The main dashboard sheet contains all the visualized metrics.
Interactive Filters (Optional): Use the filters available to narrow down the sales data by specific months or categories for more detailed analysis.
Data Source

The data used in this project was obtained from a fictional coffee shop sales dataset. It includes information on transaction date, time, product category, and sales amount for each transaction.

Future Enhancements

Adding advanced filtering options for further data exploration.
Incorporating additional metrics such as customer demographics, average transaction value, or cost of goods sold.
Expanding the dashboard with more visualizations like heat maps or pie charts.
